### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD candidate at **Lund University** with a focus on **static analysis** and **compiler construction**. Over the years, I have contributed to several **open-source projects** such as the **ExtendJ Java Compiler** and the **JastAdd Metacompiler**. My work involves developing tools and techniques for **efficient static analysis**, particularly around **control-flow** and **dataflow analysis**.

In addition to my research, I enjoy teaching and have been a **teaching assistant** for courses in **compilers** and **program analysis**. I have also supervised several **MSc students**, helping them extend open-source projects and refine their programming skills.

I am always keen on improving software tools, making them more efficient, and sharing my knowledge with others.
